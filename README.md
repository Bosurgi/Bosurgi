## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I recently enrolled for a MEng in Computers Science at Leeds Beckett University and I greatly desire to improve my professional skills exponentially and expand my knowledge around my passions, which are Computers, Videogames and Technology in general. 
In these years I had the chance to get know the Agile methodology and improve my programming skills. 
I am working on a research using Gem5 regarding Linux Operative Systems.
